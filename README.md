# PythonManimAudio
As the title says is combines python and manim library as well as pydub. Render time is pretty long to be honest but if you ever need to use it for something feel free to :)...

1: Make sure to you have manim, pydub and python installed. 
2: Put your sound file in the same folder as AA.py(exmp put both files on Desktop)
3: When you input your file name in AUDIO_FILE on line 9 include .wav or .mp4 or other extensions
4: If you know how change other parameters in the code but you are on your own from there :/
5: Open powershell on windows in the directory where both files are and type:

                manim -p AA.py AspidaAudio
                       l
                       you can remmove -p if you do no want it to play after rendering 

Your final product should be in the same directory where others were just behind a few folders, and you should add audio seperately if someone knows how to add audio to the final render in the code or how i could cut back on rendering time pls message me...
