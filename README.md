# PythonManimAudio
As the title says is combines python and manim library as well as pydub to create an audio visualizer. Render time is pretty long to be honest but if you ever need to use it for something feel free to :)...

1: Make sure to you have manim, pydub and python installed (you can run setup.bat but python will not be installed with it you have to do it manually). 
2: Put your sound file in the same folder as AA.py and Renderer.bat (exmp put all files on Desktop or a folder called whatever)
3: Open Renderer.bat and follow the instructions
4: If you know how change other parameters in the python code you can but you are on your own from there :/


Your final product should be in the same directory where others were just behind a few folders(media specifically and couple others), and you should add audio seperately if someone knows how to add audio to the final render in the code or how i could cut back on rendering time pls message me...
